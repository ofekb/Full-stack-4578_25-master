# Step 1 - create the DB models


### Users
```json
 {
        firstName: {
            type: String,
            required: true,
            minlength: 2,
            maxlength: 15
        },
        lastName: {
            type: String,
            required: true,
            minlength: 2,
            maxlength: 15
        },
        userName: {
            type: String,
            required: true,
            unique: true,
            minlength: 2,
            maxlength: 15
        },
        password: {
            type: String,
            required: true,
            minlength: 5,
            maxlength: 10
        },
        cart: {
            type: []
        }
}
```

### Books
```json
{
    id: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
        minlength: 12,
        maxlength: 12
    },
    volumeInfo: {
        title: {
            type: String,
            required: true,
            minlength: 1
        },
        subtitle: {
            type: String
        },
        authors: {
            type: []
        },
        publisher: {
            type: String
        },
        publishedDate: {
            type: String
        },
        description: {
            type: String
        },
        pageCount: {
            type: Number,
            min: 1
        },
        imageLinks: {
            thumbnail: {
                type: String
            }
        }
}
```

# Step 2 - create the node server
The server side will use `express` as a web server.   
The server will contain the following controllers:
* Books Controller
    * `Get` - return all the books from the db
    * `Get` - a specific book - by the book id
    * `Post` - add a new book - *only by the manager*
* Users Controller
    * `Get` - this will serve all the login requests (will get from the header the user details, and return a token if the user exists)
    * `Post` - add a new user  - this will serve all the sign-up requests
    * `Put` - will update the user's cart with a new book that the user added to his cart - *only by a logged in user*

# Step 3 - test the node server with `curl`
### Users Controller -    
for the following requests we will use this user info:
```json
{
        firstName:"Bob",
        lastName: "Bryce",
        userName: "BobB",
        password: "abcde"
}
```
*Note:* the password must be sent to the server with a hash256 format
```
src password: abcde
hash256 password: 36bbe50ed96841d10443bcb670d6554f0a34b761be67ec9c4a8ad2c0c44ca42c
```
* Post - with valid data for a new user
```
